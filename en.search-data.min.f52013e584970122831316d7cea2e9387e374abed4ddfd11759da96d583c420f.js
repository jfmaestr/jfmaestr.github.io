They can (usually) already interpret slope and y-intercept from a graph and concrete applications. In this unit, the first foreign concept is introduced: quadratics. Students will master methods of manipulating quadratics and their functions, graphs, and applications.\nMain Topics with Essential Questions #   Graphs, Tables, Functions (Lessons 1, 4, 6, 7):   Students will be able to manipulate quadratic objects into a meaningful form for problem solving. Students will be able identify the best form of a quadratic (graph, function, or table) for problem solving. Students will understand the need for standardized forms of quadratics and be accustomed to each form (standard, vertex, factored). Students will identify domain and range of a quadratic function from tables and graphs. Students will distinguish linear and quadratic functions from tables.  Essential Questions:  How does the use of a graph, function, or table impact how I can solve a particular problem? Which way of thinking about a quadratic is most suitable for this problem? How do the graphical concepts of linear functions (domain, range, intercepts, rate of change) apply to quadratic contexts?   Standards: F-IF.5, F-IF.6, F-IF.8.A, F-IF.9, A.SSE.3.a    Transformations (Lessons 2, 3):   Students will be able to interpret vertex form functions and match them with the appropriate graphs. Students will be able to write a vertex form function for a given graph.  Essential Questions:  How does changing the written form of the quadratic change the graph? And vice-versa?   Standards: F-IF.4, F-BF.3    Solving Quadratics (Lesson 8, 9):   Students will be able to solve quadratics in any form by plotting the solution in Desmos and locating the roots.  Essential Questions:  What is the significance of solving for a quadratics roots? I.e. What are the mathematical benefits of solving for   \\( f(x) = 0 \\)  .   Standards: A-REI.4, A-REI.11, F-IF.7.a    Concrete Applications (Lesson 11, 12, 13):   Students will be able to interpret the meaning of the y-intercept and roots of quadratic functions in concrete applications. Students will be able to interpret the meaning of the vertex in concrete applications.  Essential Questions:  How do the parts of a quadratic (vertex, roots, y-intercept) explain phenomenon in concrete applications of quadratics?   Standards: A-CED.3    Vocabulary #   Parabola: the shape of a quadratic function Vertex: the maximum or minimum point of a parabola Y-Intercept: the point  \\( (x,y) \\)  where a graph crosses the y-axis. Roots: the solutions to the function  \\( f(x)=0 \\)  . Axis of Symmetry: the line by which the quadratic can be reflected over. X-Intercept: the point  \\( (x,y) \\)  where a graph crosses the x-axis. Equivalent to the roots of the function. Vertex Form: the form of a quadratic that emphasizes the vertex:  \\( y = a(x-h)^2 \u0026#43;k \\)   Standard Form: the form of a quadratic that emphasizes factorability:  \\( y = ax^2 \u0026#43;bx\u0026#43;c \\)   Factored Form: the form of a quadratic the emphasizes the roots (solutions to  \\( f(x)=0 \\)  ):  \\( f(x)=(ax\u0026#43;b)(cx\u0026#43;d) \\)    Standards #  Lesson Structure and Objectives #     Lesson Lesson Title Objective Essential Questions Standards     1 Introduction to Quadratics I CAN identify and label the vertex of a parabola.
