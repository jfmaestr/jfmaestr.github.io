Here\u0026rsquo;s a few of those:\n \u0026ldquo;My students just aren\u0026rsquo;t interested in math\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Students are really struggling with word problems\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;There is just too much on the curriculum calendar\u0026rdquo;  The list could go on. Conversations around these topics can be helpful, others not. But, I\u0026rsquo;ve found that collaboration, whether forced or freely done, is a great avenue to move past the pleseantries of math teacher problems since immemorial and begin to craft a vision for a classroom.\nHere is my story with my most recent collaborator, Mr. Che:\nMr. Che was assigned to me as a mentee teacher. It was my job to help him orient himself as a new teacher and show him the ropes to what teaching math looks like. Our professional relationship has evolved to much more than that over the past year.\nMr. Che is passionate about learning. He is interested in a wide variety of fields and is much more widely read than I am. I admire that in a collaborator. He has challenged me in lots of ways. I admire the collaboration we\u0026rsquo;ve done because it comes from a place of humility. We approach our job knowing we are far from the very best we want to be. It allows us room to grow.\nDecisions we have made together involve curriculum pacing, lesson design, task creation. We\u0026rsquo;ve done it all together. The beauty of creating those things is the open and caring environment we have created to explore new possibilities without judgement.\nGood collaboration starts with good resources. Mr. Che and I are always sharing new and interesting resources we find and we openly use them and share the results with each other. This approach to the classroom is refreshing to the comments I mentioned at the very beginning. We go beyond the typical conversations of \u0026ldquo;Oh those kids\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;math is just boring.\u0026rdquo; We do that because we ultimately reject those claims made in math teacher PD. We want a new vision for the math classroom.\nTo become a great car salesman (or anything really) requires positioning yourself around folks who will help build you up humbly.\n"});index.add({'id':1,'href':'/docs/portfolio/imagine/equality/','title':"Equality",'section':"Imagine",'content':"Equality\r#\r\rEveryone Deserves to Leave the Lot with a High Quality Car.\r#\r\rThe people who step onto a used car lot all have varying backgrounds. Some of them judge a good car by how pretty it looks and others know the ins and outs of the catalytic converter, the brake rotors, and everthing in-between. But, it\u0026rsquo;s the job of the salesperson to meet the buyer where they\u0026rsquo;re at. No amateur car buyer wants decades of information about the car. No experienced shopper wants to be belittled with things they already know. All of that knowledge must play into the sellers tactics.\nWhen students enter the classroom, they don\u0026rsquo;t come with the same background. Some come right at the level they are suppose to be. Some very far ahead, some rather far behind. But, in my experience, that adds a beautiful diversity to my classroom. I didn\u0026rsquo;t come to believe that though until a few things had been set in place.\nLow-Floor Entry\r#\r\rFirst, it helped when I gave students tasks that were accessible to all students from the very beginning. It took effort to find or create tasks like this, but it served students much better than worksheets or arbitrary steps to solve an arbitrary problem. Here\u0026rsquo;s a task from Illustrative Mathematics that I adapted for my classroom. This is just but one of many tasks I\u0026rsquo;ve given students that ended up going well.\n\rThis first task is to qualitatively describe the change in the pattern. Responses ranged from \u0026ldquo;I see that both patterns are increasing\u0026rdquo; to more descriptive answers like \u0026ldquo;The first pattern is changing by 2 every time. The second pattern is not changing by the same amount.\u0026quot; Some students mentioned the shapes of each pattern, mentioning the square shape of the second pattern. But, the kicker is every student responded because it was accessible to all students. If I had just done this as an example, many students would have been already zoned out, and the remaining ones would only look to mimick what I had done on the board.\nStudents starting with a win propelled us to more challenging questions and discussions about the two patterns. Even wrong answers led to brilliance! Starting with these qualitative answers allowed the playing field to be leveled and students all could contribute.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s another example (thanks Illustrative Mathematics) of a low-floor task that got students hooked instantly:\n You are walking along a beach and your toe hits something hard. You reach down, grab onto a handle, and pull out a lamp! It is sandy. You start to brush it off with your towel. Poof! A genie appears.\n  He tells you, “Thank you for freeing me from that bottle! I was getting claustrophobic. You can choose one of these purses as a reward.”\n Purse A which contains $1,000 today. If you leave it alone, it will contain $1,200 tomorrow (by magic). The next day, it will have $1,400. This pattern of $200 additional dollars per day will continue.\n    Purse B which contains 1 penny today. Leave that penny in there, because tomorrow it will magically turn into 2 pennies. The next day, there will be 4 pennies. The amount in the purse will continue to double each day.\n  The simple question \u0026ldquo;which one do you pick?\u0026rdquo; and five minutes of dead silence to work on it creates enough thinking friction in the room to set something on fire. Again, every student can approach this problem from multiple angles.\nCreating a High-Ceiling\r#\r\rBut, low-floor entry is not the only thing that levels the playing field. Task should also be high ceiling. All students should be challenged by what is put in front of them every day.\nFor example, in the pattern task, students are asked to graph the number of dots in each step. This quickly become a lesson about linear vs. non-linear functions\u0026ndash;how can we tell something is linear from a pattern, table, or graph?\nIn the genie problem, students find out that Purse B grows exponentially and eventually holds much more money. But, each task I present always has a \u0026ldquo;Ready for More?\u0026quot; question to challenge students to reach higher. In this case, I asked \u0026ldquo;What if you start in Purse A with $250,000 and it still increases by $200 every day? Do you change your mind?\u0026rdquo; This question allows those students who found the task simple to reach beyond and challenge themselves.\nEquality for all students means every student can walk away with mastery. Everyone deserves to leave the lot with a high quality car.\n"});index.add({'id':2,'href':'/docs/portfolio/inspire/professionalism/','title':"Professionalism",'section':"Inspire",'content':"Professionalism\r#\r\rDo I Dress the Part?\r#\r\rI try my best to dress like a used carsales person every day. This means patterned button down, old tie, knock off dress shoes to match. During a pandemic, it also means a mask as well.\nThere were only three weeks between my college graduation and the first lesson I taught in front of students. It felt like such a rush. Teaching was so totally different than college. I felt a lot of control and meaning in what I was doing. But, there were plenty of parts that I didn\u0026rsquo;t expect. The pyschology of my own emotions was one of them.\nIn my experience, teaching has been a truly emotional endeavor. That was a very unhealthy reality at first. I didn\u0026rsquo;t know how to save my emotions and process them later after I went home for the day. Small things often found their way under my skin. I struggled to emotionally handle a lot of what teaching required. After all, I was an emotional 22 year old who just came bursting out of a college bubble of liberal arts dicussions about geometric group theory and a postmodern study of history. I was like a fish out of water.\nHere are a few of the things I learned as best practices when it came to handling my emotions so that I was best prepared to sell some cars (erh, I mean teach math):\n Invest in a counselor. Take the time to process your emotions (especially, in the first years) so that you are not tormented by your own fears and anxiety while you teach. Begin the slow process of reconciling your emotions to what you do every day. Apologize when you mess up. Whether this is to your students, to your colleagues, or heck, to yourself, make time to apologize when you mess up. I went into teaching hearing \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t smile. don\u0026rsquo;t let them win. don\u0026rsquo;t give in.\u0026rdquo; That mindset never worked. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t until I humbled myself to apologize that students started the process of creating mutual respect. Settle your non-negotiables. Things happened in my classroom that made me dreadfully uncomfortable. In the uncomfortability, I wore my emotions on my sleeve and paid the price. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t until I set my non-negotiables that I felt safe entering my classroom and felt capable of creating that safe place for students. My biggest non-negotiables include no tolerance for discriminating language regarding race, class, gender, religion, etc. It just doesn\u0026rsquo;t happen in my classroom and continuously participating in it requires leaving my room.  Once I had the emotional toolkit ready to create safe place for me and my students, I felt like I had control over myself and my emotions in my classroom. I felt like I was finally dressing the part to make the sale.\n"});index.add({'id':3,'href':'/docs/curriculum/alg/unit1/','title':"Unit 1: Creating and Manipulating Expressions",'section':"Algebra I",'content':"Unit 1: Creating and Manipulating Expressions\r#\r\rOverview\r#\r\rMain Topics with Essential Questions\r#\r\rVocabulary\r#\r\rStandards\r#\r\rLesson Structure and Objectives\r#\r\r   Lesson Objective Essential Questions Resources     1 I CAN create expressions from real world examples What are variables, constants, and coefficients? \rdesmos    "});index.add({'id':4,'href':'/docs/curriculum/alg/unit2/','title':"Unit 2: Solving Equations and Inequalities",'section':"Algebra I",'content':"Unit 2: Solving Equations and Inequalities\r#\r\rOverview\r#\r\rMain Topics with Essential Questions\r#\r\rVocabulary\r#\r\rStandards\r#\r\rLesson Structure and Objectives\r#\r\r   Lesson Objective Essential Questions Resources     1 I CAN create expressions from real world examples What are variables, constants, and coefficients? \rdesmos    "});index.add({'id':5,'href':'/docs/curriculum/alg/unit3/','title':"Unit 3: Introduction to Functions",'section':"Algebra I",'content':"Unit 3: Introduction to Functions\r#\r\rOverview\r#\r\rMain Topics with Essential Questions\r#\r\rVocabulary\r#\r\rStandards\r#\r\rLesson Structure and Objectives\r#\r\r   Lesson Objective Essential Questions Resources     1 I CAN create expressions from real world examples What are variables, constants, and coefficients? \rdesmos    "});index.add({'id':6,'href':'/docs/curriculum/alg/unit4/','title':"Unit 4: Linear Functions (with Inequalities)",'section':"Algebra I",'content':"Unit 4: Linear Functions (with Inequalities)\r#\r\rOverview\r#\r\rMain Topics with Essential Questions\r#\r\rVocabulary\r#\r\rStandards\r#\r\rLesson Structure and Objectives\r#\r\r   Lesson Objective Essential Questions Resources     1 I CAN create expressions from real world examples What are variables, constants, and coefficients? \rdesmos    "});index.add({'id':7,'href':'/docs/curriculum/alg/unit5/','title':"Unit 5: Quadratic Functions",'section':"Algebra I",'content':"Unit 5: Quadratic Functions (or How Do Things Fall With Style)\r#\r\rToy Story Woody GIF from Toystory GIFs\rOverview\r#\r\rStudents are thoroughly familiar with linear equations before stepping foot into the Algebra I classroom.

Students are often buried waist deep in worksheets, homework, and steps to solve a problem. Students are rarely asked why we need certain math skills. Math is rarely seen as necessary. Context is almost never given.\nWatching this video was a turning point in my career in this regard. It led to discovering people much smarter than I am (good teaching is theft anyways, right?) who showed me the power, necessity, and delighfulness of math. I felt like I came to love a subject I\u0026rsquo;ve always held dear over and over and over because of it. This portfolio documents how I\u0026rsquo;ve grown in and around the idea of this video (that my classroom needed a makeover) and the impact that has had on my students and my colleagues.\nBeing a math teacher is like selling used cars.

I think differently. The dealership should be designed to achieve your main goal.\nIn my math classroom, my main goal is getting students to think critically. I\u0026rsquo;ve shown that in the tasks I give students, in the ways I assess them, and in the pedagogical practices I implement. But, there is one element of design I think makes my classroom unique.\n\rThe upside down map is a staple in my classroom. When I first hung it up, students thought weirdly of it. I got a lot of \u0026ldquo;why is it upside down?\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Mr. Maestri you are a weirdo.\u0026rdquo; But, I quickly tried to make a learning opportunity out of it. I asked \u0026ldquo;What direction is at the top of the map?\u0026rdquo; and students all answer \u0026ldquo;North!\u0026rdquo; I follow up: \u0026ldquo;And who says so?\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;ve gotten many responses of which my favorite are \u0026ldquo;God\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;the government.\u0026rdquo;\nI want students to enter my room ready to flip the script on how to think. Part of thinking critically is being able to question even the most engrained ideas in our brains. The upside map is a fundamental visual cue to that end in my classroom.\nI also fimrly believe that students should utilize all of the room to learn. This meant having students walking around the room for stations involving quick problems to tackle in small groups.\n   Transversals Triangles     \r \r    Right triangle trigonometry and transversals required putting images of them on the floor with tape! We played a few games of \u0026ldquo;Dance Dance Transversal\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Dance Dance Trigonometry\u0026rdquo; both of which were references to a game that immeadiately went over students heads.\nEven the color of the room can be used to help brighten what happens in the room. My dad came and helped me paint my room in January 2020.\n\rThe room might just be four walls. It might have desks in rows.

In an ideal world, these extra tasks make you a better salesman.\nIn my short two years at Byhalia High School, I became the most senior math teacher at the ripe age of 23. I assumed a lot of leadership responsibilities many teachers don\u0026rsquo;t receive until much later in their career. I can definitively say this was not good. It marked a lot of the problems with teacher retention and shortage. But, what I did learn by being thrust into those positions was useful and made me a better educator in the classroom.\nI served as Math Department Chair for the 2020-21 school year. This position required strategic planning of math department priorities under a new principal. It often meant arguing and positioning for curriculum and pedagogy that my singular colleague in the department and I believed in. It also meant figuring a lot of things out on my own which was a task that started difficult and got easier over time.\nI mentored the other member of the department who began their first year while I was chair. This relationship was meaningful to me in many ways, most importantly to gain a co-worker I trusted and respected and who quickly became a better educator than me in a lot of ways. I enjoyed forming a relationship that felt equal and led to many constructive conversations about how we could best improve our craft.\nBy sticking around for another year after my first, I learned what it was like to gain additional responsibilities after proving yourself somewhat capable. I began to lead PD sessions in both my school and district. This dialogue with other teachers was an invaluable resource for myself in the classroom. I often found myself leading by simply listening. Those in the meetings knew much more than me and offered much more wisdom.\nLeadership in all these roles required a large dose of humility, especially as I was put into those positions while still new and under-qualified. I witnessed a lot ways I could grow in my profession.\n"});index.add({'id':18,'href':'/docs/portfolio/imagine/pedagogyknow/','title':"Pedagogical Knowledge",'section':"Imagine",'content':"Excellence in Pedagogical Knowledge\r#\r\rGet This! You Need to Know How to Sell a Car\r#\r\rMany people can say they know a lot about cars. Maybe they listened to Car Talk on the weekends too. But, very few can say they know how to sell a car.\nThis is the hard part: I like to think I know a lot about math. I loved math growing up. I had math teachers that influenced me to pursue math in college. I did undergraduate research in mathematics. But, when it comes to convincing other people to love math, it\u0026rsquo;s hard. Especially when students have built up math trauma.\nStudents never quite bought into lecture followed by examples. It was a dry, boring way to introduce students to math. This page represents the many new tools I\u0026rsquo;ve learned about how to create content that is engaging and relevant to student lives.\nInstructional Technology\r#\r\r\rYou heard it: \u0026ldquo;The vast majority of Ed-Tech is garbage.\u0026rdquo; That quote comes from Eli Luberoff, CEO of Desmos, one of the fastest growing educational technology companies with a brilliant middle school curriculum. Give that full podcast a listen if you have time.\nI think Eli is right and I can testify to it as someone who has tried it all. Most of it is garbage. But, there are a few that hit home and I\u0026rsquo;ll highlight how I use them here.\n  \rDesmos Activity Builder: The single best tool for creating math activities. This tool takes the power of the desmos calculator and combines it with facilitation tools that create a front row seat for every student to delight in mathematics. I commited some to becoming comfortable with the Computation Layer scripts to make extra functionality in each activity.\nHere is an activity I created based off those principles.\nAnd this is a collection of activities on quadratics and a collection on exponentials that I used heavily for those respective units.\n  \rGoogle Drive: Google Drive acts as the glue that binds together a lesson. It often is not the feature element of a lesson like Desmos or Edulastic. But, a Google Form Exit Ticket is usually just the right thing to end a lesson. Google Docs makes sharing tasks with other teachers or EL and SPED interventionists simple. The list of ways Google Drive binds my classroom together are endless. To further my knowledge of Google Drive, I became a Level 2 Google Certified Educator which demonstrated \u0026ldquo;advanced technology implementation skills.\u0026rdquo;\n  Instructional Strategies\r#\r\r  Notice and Wonder: Sometimes when introducing students to a topic it\u0026rsquo;s enough to show them an image (graph, equation, table) and ask \u0026ldquo;What do you notice? What do you wonder?\u0026rdquo; I found that student grasp the question style better if I preface that \u0026ldquo;notices\u0026rdquo; are the things you see and the \u0026ldquo;wonders\u0026rdquo; are the questions you have about those \u0026ldquo;notices.\u0026rdquo;\n  Which One Doesn\u0026rsquo;t Belong: I still have students who lovingly hate this question type and it all stems from the fact that there is usually no correct answer. Before students discuss their reasoning for their selection, I take a poll. Students are at first shy to answer differently from their classmates, but I\u0026rsquo;ve had some students embrace that being the only one to select an option means they are thinking differently than everyone else! Students justify their answer and contribute to a discussion on which answer doesn\u0026rsquo;t belong.   Explain Your Answer with Sentence Starters: Through Desmos Activity Builder and Google Drive, I found a great way for students to write about their justification and reasoning. But, some students still struggled. Sentence starters were the bridge to making justification accessible to all students. Adding a simple \u0026ldquo;I chose [blank] because\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; to the text box increased the number of good student response dramatically.\n  Estimates First: Having students give an estimate of a solution to a problem first creates a low floor entry very quickly. In this example, students had to estimate how far they could throw a snowball. This question opened up a discussion about the best way to throw a snowball and helped us frame the problem before getting started.   Card Sorts: For skills that require a degree of quickness, I choose card sorts to re-inforce the skills. Desmos makes it easy to give instant feedback to students on their own screens to see if they got it correct.   Problem Solving and Conceptual Understanding\r#\r\rWhen I first was creating lessons, the process was simple. Three examples, a few informal checks, and then independent practice. But, I noticed a few things. First, little \u0026ldquo;learning\u0026rdquo; was happening. Students were mostly just mimicking what I was doing and got confused when asked to do something slightly different. Second, students had little time to be creators of knowledge. Most of what students did was a passive engagement.\nA lot of that changed in my second year. Desmos has a list of creation principle that I try my best to apply in my own classroom:\n Create opportunities for students to be right and wrong in different, interesting ways. Give feedback that attaches meaning to student thinking. Create a need. Use a variety of resources. Interrupt our biases.  These are nice cues to look at while planning an activity or interpreting how I will implement a resources that has already been created. These principles drastically changed how I viewed the learning process.\nWith these tasks and activities now in my tool kit, I started to witness what it was like for students to productively struggle. That is, I watched students get stuck and unstuck in ways I didn\u0026rsquo;t see in a lecture-practice classroom. We began to learn in a totally different, more organic way.\nIt required a lot of me as a professional to sharpen my skills as well. I had to be more intentional about questions I answered. I had to prepare more in anticipation of how students would solve a task. It is still a work in progress, but it is a much more enjoyable classroom environment to be in.\nReasoning, Communication, Connections, and Representations\r#\r\rIn their book 5 Practices for Orchestrating Productive Mathematics Discussions, Smith and Stein outline a process for mathematical discussions centered around quality math tasks. This resource gave structure to the often chaotic discussions I was trying to facilitate in my classroom. Here\u0026rsquo;s an outline of that process:\n Anticipate: Quality discussions began with better preparation on my part as the teacher. Creating a template to solve tasks in as many ways as possible to be prepared for students was critical to moving forward with discussion. This meant writing out all the solutions and creating assessing and advancing questions to prepare for the next step. Monitor: Using what I had prepared, I could begin to track and monitor how students (groups or individuals) were attacking a certain task. I felt better prepared to help students who were stuck and assess students who were on the right track. Select: Students would produce different solutions to a problem using different methods, by virtue of the task being accessible to all students. I would select group responses to the task to further the learning goal and highlight relevant methods for solving the problem. Sequence: I would sequence those selected responses to create a relevant stream of learning. Often, I would select the most unique solutions first, and then work toward the more mainstream. Connect: This part of the process required student engagement with other groups responses. We would draw connections between different approaches in order to consolidate the days learning.  This process created a truly equitable classroom and did the differentiation for me. If a task was truly low-floor, all students could make meaning of it. If a task was truly high-ceiling, no student would remained bored. It still takes time for me to find and/or create these types of tasks and sometimes they still fall flat. But, it is easy to then find what went wrong and tweak for next time.\nStudents never wanted to buy the cars I was selling at first. I was a dry-voiced salesman with not much to offer. But, these resources showed me how to sell the car and make it meaningful for those I was selling to.\n"});index.add({'id':19,'href':'/docs/book_reviews/','title':"Book Reviews",'section':"Docs",'content':"Book Reviews\r#\r\rThe largest part of my teaching development has been through reading books by folks much smarter than me.

(Credit to Kurt Salisbury for this slide!)\n\rBefore students complete any math for the day they let me know how they\u0026rsquo;re doing. This 1 minute exercise gives me enough information to tell how a class is doing as a whole and who my outliers might be who are having a rougher day.\nSome students even like sharing briefly about why they picked their answers. \u0026ldquo;Mr. Maestri, I\u0026rsquo;m so tired because we got home late from the basketball game!\u0026quot; Valuable. \u0026ldquo;I stayed up late playing the new update to Call of Duty!\u0026quot; Valuable, but also Get. Some. Sleep. And my favorite: \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m feeling wide awake today!\u0026quot;\nAnd note: this small activity isn\u0026rsquo;t complete without some math involved. Students use their skills to understand plotting points on the xy-plane to assess how they are feeling!\nTaking Feedback to Heart\r#\r\rCaring comes into play by listening to students and evaluating their feedback. For instance, due to COVID-19, the school year of 2020-21 required students to do so much more at home. It gave me a glimpse into students lives at home. It took about 4 months of trying to do homework packets that eventually a class of 15 year olds humbled me, saying: \u0026ldquo;We just don\u0026rsquo;t have time to do the homework. I go home and take care of a sibling. I go home and have to get so much done before my parent gets off work or they get mad. I go home and my mom has all this stuff planned and no time for homework.\u0026rdquo; I didn\u0026rsquo;t realize how little of their time was actually free. I heard their feedback and coming back from Christmas break we got rid of homework packets knowing that we would have to do more in class. And students stepped up.\nCommunication That Works\r#\r\rMy goal for each student\u0026rsquo;s social and emotional learning is to get to a point that they feel comfortable telling me that they are having a bad day. To draw a parallel to math content, this mile stone is their mastery task. If a student can tell me that they are upset or not having a good day on their way into class, then I am prepared to help them.\nIf that communication doesn\u0026rsquo;t happen at the door and I see a student struggling, it can definitely happen in a hall conference. Giving students a few minutes to breathe in the hall if they are angry or a moment to talk about what is going on, allows students to get the trouble off of them. No student can begin to do math when plagued by anxiety, depression, or stress. I\u0026rsquo;ve found those hall moments to be effective ways for students to learn how to process emotions and then return to classroom learning when ready.\nIn order to learn mathematics, students must feel safe in my classroom. In order to sell the car, I have to make sure the customer had adequate conditions to buy in.\n"});})();
