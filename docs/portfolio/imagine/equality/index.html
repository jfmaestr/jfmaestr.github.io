<p>The people who step onto a used car lot all have varying backgrounds. Some of them judge a good car by how pretty it looks and others know the ins and outs of the catalytic converter, the brake rotors, and everthing in-between. But, it&rsquo;s the job of the salesperson to meet the buyer where they&rsquo;re at. No amateur car buyer wants decades of information about the car. No experienced shopper wants to be belittled with things they already know. All of that knowledge must play into the sellers tactics.</p>
<p>When students enter the classroom, they don&rsquo;t come with the same background. Some come right at the level they are suppose to be. Some very far ahead, some rather far behind. But, in my experience, that adds a beautiful diversity to my classroom. I didn&rsquo;t come to believe that though until a few things had been set in place.</p>

  <strong>Low-Floor Entry</strong>

<p>First, it helped when I gave students tasks that were accessible to all students from the very beginning. It took effort to find or create tasks like this, but it served students much better than worksheets or arbitrary steps to solve an arbitrary problem. Here&rsquo;s a task from 
  <a href="https://curriculum.illustrativemathematics.org/HS/teachers/1/6/2/index.html">Illustrative Mathematics</a> that I adapted for my classroom. This is just but one of many tasks I&rsquo;ve given students that ended up going well.</p>
<p>
  <img src="/equalitytask.PNG" alt="Example image" /></p>
<p>This first task is to qualitatively describe the change in the pattern. Responses ranged from <strong>&ldquo;I see that both patterns are increasing&rdquo;</strong> to more descriptive answers like <strong>&ldquo;The first pattern is changing by 2 every time. The second pattern is not changing by the same amount.&quot;</strong> Some students mentioned the shapes of each pattern, mentioning the square shape of the second pattern. But, the kicker is <strong>every student responded</strong> because it was accessible to all students. If I had just done this as an example, many students would have been already zoned out, and the remaining ones would only look to mimick what I had done on the board.</p>
<p>Students starting with a win propelled us to more challenging questions and discussions about the two patterns. Even wrong answers led to brilliance! Starting with these qualitative answers allowed the playing field to be leveled and students all could contribute.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another example (thanks 
  <a href="https://curriculum.illustrativemathematics.org/HS/teachers/1/5/1/index.html">Illustrative Mathematics</a>) of a low-floor task that got students hooked instantly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>You are walking along a beach and your toe hits something hard. You reach down, grab onto a handle, and pull out a lamp! It is sandy. You start to brush it off with your towel. Poof! A genie appears.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>He tells you, “Thank you for freeing me from that bottle! I was getting claustrophobic. You can choose one of these purses as a reward.”</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Purse A which contains $1,000 today. If you leave it alone, it will contain $1,200 tomorrow (by magic). The next day, it will have $1,400. This pattern of $200 additional dollars per day will continue.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Purse B which contains 1 penny today. Leave that penny in there, because tomorrow it will magically turn into 2 pennies. The next day, there will be 4 pennies. The amount in the purse will continue to double each day.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The simple question &ldquo;which one do you pick?&rdquo; and five minutes of dead silence to work on it creates enough thinking friction in the room to set something on fire. Again, every student can approach this problem from multiple angles.</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-high-ceiling">
  <strong>Creating a High-Ceiling</strong>
  <a class="anchor" href="#creating-a-high-ceiling">#</a>
</h3>
<p>But, low-floor entry is not the only thing that levels the playing field. Task should also be high ceiling. All students should be challenged by what is put in front of them every day.</p>
<p>For example, in the pattern task, students are asked to graph the number of dots in each step. This quickly become a lesson about linear vs. non-linear functions&ndash;how can we tell something is linear from a pattern, table, or graph?</p>
<p>In the genie problem, students find out that Purse B grows exponentially and eventually holds much more money. But, each task I present always has a <strong>&ldquo;Ready for More?&quot;</strong> question to challenge students to reach higher. In this case, I asked &ldquo;What if you start in Purse A with $250,000 and it still increases by $200 every day? Do you change your mind?&rdquo; This question allows those students who found the task simple to reach beyond and challenge themselves.</p>
<p>Equality for all students means every student can walk away with mastery. Everyone deserves to leave the lot with a high quality car.</p>
