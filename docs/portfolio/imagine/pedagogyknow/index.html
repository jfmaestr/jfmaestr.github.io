<p>This is the hard part: I like to think I know a lot about math. I loved math growing up. I had math teachers that influenced me to pursue math in college. I did 
  <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EqA9OO2-GjZU0YYOdGfEDJ156PI_XDMu/view?usp=sharing"><strong>undergraduate research in mathematics</strong></a>. But, when it comes to convincing other people to love math, it&rsquo;s hard. Especially when students have built up 
  <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/009155218401200206?journalCode=crwa"><strong>math trauma</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Students never quite bought into lecture followed by examples. It was a dry, boring way to introduce students to math. This page represents the many new tools I&rsquo;ve learned about how to create content that is engaging and relevant to student lives.</p>

<p>You heard it: &ldquo;The vast majority of Ed-Tech is garbage.&rdquo; That quote comes from

<p>I think Eli is right and I can testify to it as someone who has tried it all. Most of it is garbage. But, there are a few that hit home and I&rsquo;ll highlight how I use them here.</p>

  <a href="https://teacher.desmos.com/">Desmos Activity Builder</a>: The single best tool for creating math activities. This tool takes the power of the desmos calculator and combines it with facilitation tools that create a front row seat for every student to delight in mathematics. I commited some to becoming comfortable with the 
  <a href="https://teacher.desmos.com/computation-layer/documentation">Computation Layer scripts</a> to make extra functionality in each activity.</p>
<p>Here is

<p>And this is a 
  <a href="https://teacher.desmos.com/collection/60083078d152670d30963183">collection of activities on quadratics</a> and a 
  <a href="https://teacher.desmos.com/collection/601aa5a228e3250d621df6ab">collection on exponentials</a> that I used heavily for those respective units.</p>
</li>

<p>
  <a href="https://drive.google.com">Google Drive</a>: Google Drive acts as the glue that binds together a lesson. It often is not the feature element of a lesson like Desmos or Edulastic. But, a Google Form Exit Ticket is usually just the right thing to end a lesson.
Google Docs makes sharing tasks with other teachers or EL and SPED interventionists simple. The list of ways Google Drive binds my classroom together are endless. To further my knowledge of Google Drive, I became a

<p><strong>Notice and Wonder</strong>: Sometimes when introducing students to a topic it&rsquo;s enough to show them an image (graph, equation, table) and ask &ldquo;What do you notice? What do you wonder?&rdquo; I found that student grasp the question style better if I preface that &ldquo;notices&rdquo; are the things you see and the &ldquo;wonders&rdquo; are the questions you have about those &ldquo;notices.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Which One Doesn&rsquo;t Belong</strong>: I still have students who lovingly hate this question type and it all stems from the fact that there is usually no correct answer. Before students discuss their reasoning for their selection, I take a poll. Students are at first shy to answer differently from their classmates, but I&rsquo;ve had some students embrace that being the only one to select an option means they are thinking differently than everyone else! Students justify their answer and contribute to a discussion on which answer doesn&rsquo;t belong.

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Explain Your Answer with Sentence Starters</strong>: Through Desmos Activity Builder and Google Drive, I found a great way for students to write about their justification and reasoning. But, some students still struggled. Sentence starters were the bridge to making justification accessible to all students. Adding a simple &ldquo;I chose [blank] because&hellip;&rdquo; to the text box increased the number of good student response dramatically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Estimates First</strong>: Having students give an estimate of a solution to a problem first creates a low floor entry very quickly. In this example, students had to estimate how far they could throw a snowball. This question opened up a discussion about the best way to throw a snowball and helped us frame the problem before getting started.

<li>
<p><strong>Card Sorts</strong>: For skills that require a degree of quickness, I choose card sorts to re-inforce the skills. Desmos makes it easy to give instant feedback to students on their own screens to see if they got it correct.

  <strong>Problem Solving and Conceptual Understanding</strong>

<p>When I first was creating lessons, the process was simple. Three examples, a few informal checks, and then independent practice. But, I noticed a few things. First, little &ldquo;learning&rdquo; was happening. Students were mostly just mimicking what I was doing and got confused when asked to do something slightly different. Second, students had little time to be creators of knowledge. Most of what students did was a passive engagement.</p>
<p>A lot of that changed in my second year. Desmos has a 
  <a href="https://blog.desmos.com/articles/desmos-guide-to-building-great-digital-math-2021/">list of creation principle</a> that I try my best to apply in my own classroom:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create opportunities for students to be right and wrong in different, interesting ways.</li>
<li>Give feedback that attaches meaning to student thinking.</li>
<li>Create a need.</li>
<li>Use a variety of resources.</li>
<li>Interrupt our biases.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are nice cues to look at while planning an activity or interpreting how I will implement a resources that has already been created. These principles drastically changed how I viewed the learning process.</p>
<p>With these tasks and activities now in my tool kit, I started to witness what it was like for students to productively struggle. That is, I watched students get stuck and unstuck in ways I didn&rsquo;t see in a lecture-practice classroom. We began to learn in a totally different, more organic way.</p>
<p>It required a lot of me as a professional to sharpen my skills as well. I had to be more intentional about questions I answered. I had to prepare more in anticipation of how students would solve a task. It is still a work in progress, but it is a much more enjoyable classroom environment to be in.</p>

<p>In their book 
  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Practices-Orchestrating-Productive-Mathematical-Discussion/dp/1680540165/ref=pd_sbs_1?pd_rd_w=sweVJ&amp;pf_rd_p=651d64d1-3c73-45b6-ae09-e545600e3a22&amp;pf_rd_r=J287N06S6ZC0AKH3RN8E&amp;pd_rd_r=b8860828-6a1d-4d63-a830-49f7e4b6d0ea&amp;pd_rd_wg=N4dBB&amp;pd_rd_i=1680540165&amp;psc=1"><strong>5 Practices for Orchestrating Productive Mathematics Discussions</strong></a>, Smith and Stein outline a process for mathematical discussions centered around quality math tasks. This resource gave structure to the often chaotic discussions I was trying to facilitate in my classroom. Here&rsquo;s an outline of that process:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Anticipate</strong>: Quality discussions began with better preparation on my part as the teacher. Creating a template to solve tasks in as many ways as possible to be prepared for students was critical to moving forward with discussion. This meant writing out all the solutions and creating <em>assessing</em> and <em>advancing</em> questions to prepare for the next step.</li>
<li><strong>Monitor</strong>: Using what I had prepared, I could begin to track and monitor how students (groups or individuals) were attacking a certain task. I felt better prepared to help students who were stuck and assess students who were on the right track.</li>
<li><strong>Select</strong>: Students would produce different solutions to a problem using different methods, by virtue of the task being accessible to all students. I would select group responses to the task to further the learning goal and highlight relevant methods for solving the problem.</li>
<li><strong>Sequence</strong>: I would sequence those selected responses to create a relevant stream of learning. Often, I would select the most unique solutions first, and then work toward the more mainstream.</li>
<li><strong>Connect</strong>: This part of the process required student engagement with other groups responses. We would draw connections between different approaches in order to consolidate the days learning.</li>
</ol>
<p>This process created a truly equitable classroom and did the differentiation for me. If a task was truly low-floor, all students could make meaning of it. If a task was truly high-ceiling, no student would remained bored. It still takes time for me to find and/or create these types of tasks and sometimes they still fall flat. But, it is easy to then find what went wrong and tweak for next time.</p>
<p>Students never wanted to buy the cars I was selling at first. I was a dry-voiced salesman with not much to offer. But, these resources showed me how to sell the car and make it meaningful for those I was selling to.</p>
