      <description>Collaboration#A Bunch of Car Salespersons Walk into a Room&amp;hellip;#In my experience, when math teachers all get together to chat a few things come up over and over again. Here&amp;rsquo;s a few of those:
 &amp;ldquo;My students just aren&amp;rsquo;t interested in math&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Students are really struggling with word problems&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;There is just too much on the curriculum calendar&amp;rdquo;  The list could go on. Conversations around these topics can be helpful, others not.</description>

      <description>Equality#Everyone Deserves to Leave the Lot with a High Quality Car.#The people who step onto a used car lot all have varying backgrounds. Some of them judge a good car by how pretty it looks and others know the ins and outs of the catalytic converter, the brake rotors, and everthing in-between. But, it&amp;rsquo;s the job of the salesperson to meet the buyer where they&amp;rsquo;re at.</description>

      <description>Professionalism#Do I Dress the Part?#I try my best to dress like a used carsales person every day. This means patterned button down, old tie, knock off dress shoes to match. During a pandemic, it also means a mask as well.
There were only three weeks between my college graduation and the first lesson I taught in front of students. It felt like such a rush.</description>

      <description>Excellence in Content Knowledge#You Need to Know a Lot about Cars#If you are going to sell cars (let alone anything!), you need to know a lot about cars!
We live in a world where saying &amp;ldquo;I just can&amp;rsquo;t do math&amp;rdquo; is about as fashionable as it gets. I&amp;rsquo;ve even met math teachers who struggle with certain concepts and topics. Content knowledge is often neglected. Math is as simple as doing examples on the board and then monitoring students doing similar examples, right?</description>

      <description>Practice#Does the Dealership Look Nice?#Most folks think the dealership should pop with modern design and vibrant colors. I think differently. The dealership should be designed to achieve your main goal.
In my math classroom, my main goal is getting students to think critically. I&amp;rsquo;ve shown that in the tasks I give students, in the ways I assess them, and in the pedagogical practices I implement.</description>

      <description>Transformation#Look Within to be a Better Salesperson#No one ever makes a successful first sale. It takes a while before you learn the trade well enough to be confident in making a sale.
I entered teaching as a fresh college graduate. I lived in a world of round table discussions about post-colonial history and whiteboards with math proofs on them. It was an ideal world, but had little roots in reality.</description>

      <description>Assessment#What&amp;rsquo;s the Current Buying Rate?#Salesfolks need to stay up to date with the current buying rate constantly. If you don&amp;rsquo;t where your buyer is at, you won&amp;rsquo;t make the sale either.
In my classroom, the main way I evaluate student learning is through exit tickets.
Exit Tickets serve two purposes:
 Evaluate mastery of the learning goal. Evaluate student perception of mastery.  Exit tickets utilize the same google form template every day in my classroom.</description>

      <description>Leadership#My Responsiblities Beyond the Dealership#A carsalesman has many responsibilities beyond the dealership. In an ideal world, these extra tasks make you a better salesman.
In my short two years at Byhalia High School, I became the most senior math teacher at the ripe age of 23. I assumed a lot of leadership responsibilities many teachers don&amp;rsquo;t receive until much later in their career. I can definitively say this was not good.</description>

      <description>Excellence in Pedagogical Knowledge#Get This! You Need to Know How to Sell a Car#Many people can say they know a lot about cars. Maybe they listened to Car Talk on the weekends too. But, very few can say they know how to sell a car.
This is the hard part: I like to think I know a lot about math. I loved math growing up.</description>

      <description>Caring#Treat Your Market Kindly#A lot of my caring for students begins here with this slide. (Credit to Kurt Salisbury for this slide!)
Before students complete any math for the day they let me know how they&amp;rsquo;re doing. This 1 minute exercise gives me enough information to tell how a class is doing as a whole and who my outliers might be who are having a rougher day.</description>
